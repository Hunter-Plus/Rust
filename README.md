# Readme

I’m using this repo to summarize Rust knowledge and sample codes from https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

I’m be continually working on this repo and use it as my quick reference for Rust topics.

Please remember that this reference can never be perfect and well rounded, meaning it’s just for the usage of myself.
